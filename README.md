# ResistorSorter
Sorts many resistors into a matching and unique pair. If no pair is found within the acceptable tolerance, the code will add a standard resistor value to match the two resistrors.
This is useful in production scale of electronics, where a device might be sensitive to resistor values and having minimal difference is key. Sometimes using extremely accurate resistors is either too expensive or they don't have enough accuracy
